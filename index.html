            <h4 id="how-does-sober-work" class="h4">How does Luaxperience work?</h4>
            <p>Luaxperience creates a specialized runtime environment for Roblox, bridging the gap between Android and Linux, allowing native-like performance on non-Windows platforms.</p>

            <h4 id="cant-see-bundle" class="h4">Why can’t I see my app bundle?</h4>
            <p>If you’re experiencing issues with the file picker, it may be due to missing Desktop Portals on your system. Check out <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal">this guide</a> for more info.</p>

            <h4 id="how-does-sober-wdork" class="h4">Why does Luaxperience keep crashing?</h4>
            <p>Luaxperience is still in experimental stages, so crashes are expected. Help us improve by submitting logs through the terminal using the command <code>flatpak run org.vinegarhq.Sober</code>.</p>

            <h4 id="is-it-official" class="h4">Is Luaxperience official?</h4>
