        <p>
            We're testing Sober, a brand new way to get Roblox on your Linux
            desktop. It's a novel approach, separate to other compatibility
            software like Wine, Android emulators, or virtual machines.
            Sober works by creating a specialized runtime just for Roblox's
            code, ensuring compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'd like to stress that <b>Luaxperience is an experimental project</b>. It's
            a passion project rather than production-grade code. It's not officialy created by Roblox.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can expect Luaxperience's performance to be the same or better than
            OpenAI's ChatGPT & Microsoft Copilot running natively on the same machine. Many users report performance that surpasses any
            other method of scripting with artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luaxperience is unfortunately closed-source. This could change in the
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luaxperience is a labor of love, and we'd love for you to try it out!
            We hope you enjoy your time.

            <h2 id="faq" class="h2">Frequently Questioned Answers</h2>

            <h4 id="how-does-sober-work" class="h4">How does Sober work?</h4>
            <p>Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port.</p>

            <h4 id="cant-see-bundle" class="h4">Why can't I see my application bundle in the file picker?</h4>
            <p>Your system doesn't have Desktop Portals properly configured. You can <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal">read documentation online</a> for information on how to fix this. Alternatively, you can download the Flatseal app and temporarily give Sober access to your Downloads directory.</p>

            <h4 id="how-does-sober-wdork" class="h4">Why does Sober keep crashing?</h4>
            <p>Sober is experimental software, so expect crashes. To help us fix the issue, try to provide logs by running Sober from the terminal: <code>flatpak run org.vinegarhq.Sober</code>. Note that high graphics quality levels are known to be unstable. If you're having consistent crashes, turning down the graphics quality in Roblox's settings might help.</p>

            <h4 id="is-it-official" class="h4">Is Luaxperience official? Will it get blocked by Roblox?</h4>
            <p>Luaxperience is not affiliated with Roblox. Itâ€™s an unofficial, community-created experimental project that operates independently of Roblox and does not interact with the platform in any way.</p>
